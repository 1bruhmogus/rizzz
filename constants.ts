  <h1>Mitochondria</h1>
  <p>The mitochondrion is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms. Some cells in some multicellular organisms may, however, lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Structure</h2>
  <p>A mitochondrion contains outer and inner membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers and proteins. The two membranes have different properties. Because of this double-membraned organization, there are five distinct parts to a mitochondrion:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The outer mitochondrial membrane</li>
    <li>The intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes)</li>
    <li>The inner mitochondrial membrane</li>
    <li>The cristae space (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane)</li>
    <li>The matrix (space within the inner membrane)</li>
  </ul>
